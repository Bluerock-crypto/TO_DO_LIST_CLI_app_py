📝 Console-Based To-Do List Application

📌 Project Description

This is a simple console-based To-Do List application built using Python as part of the Elevate Labs – Python Developer Internship task.

The application allows users to manage their daily tasks through a command-line interface.
Tasks are stored in a text file, making the application persistent — meaning tasks remain saved even after the program is closed and reopened.

📂 How It Works

1. At program startup:

The application reads tasks from TO_DO_LIST.txt (if it exists).

Tasks are loaded into a list.



2. The user is shown a menu with options:

Add Task

Remove Task

Mark Task as Done

View Tasks

Quit



3. After any modification (Add / Remove / Mark):

The updated task list is rewritten into the text file.

This ensures data persistence.
